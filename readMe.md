### Create Schema
  // sequelize.query('CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS business;')
  // .then(() => console.log('Schema created successfully'))
  // .catch(error => console.error('Error creating schema:', error));

#### Drop schema
<!-- DROP SCHEMA business CASCADE; -->




  // try {
  //   // Start a new transaction
  //   const t = await sequelize.transaction();

  //   // Create a new organization
  //   const organization = await Organization.create({
  //     organization_name: req.body.organizationName,
  //     subscription_tier: req.body.subscriptionTier,
  //     billing_details: req.body.billingDetails,
  //   }, { transaction: t });

  //   // Create a new user
  //   const user = await OrganizationUser.create({
  //     user_id: req.body.userId,
  //     organization_id: organization.organization_id,
  //     role_id: req.body.roleId,
  //   }, { transaction: t });

  //   // Commit the transaction
  //   await t.commit();

  //   res.json({ organization, user });

  // } catch (error) {
  //   // If there is an error, rollback the transaction
  //   await t.rollback();
  //   res.status(500).json({ error });
  // }


  ### Limiting user access

- const allowedFields = {
  admin: ['name', 'email'], // password is not included
  employee: ['name', 'email', 'password'],
  // ...
};

const role = getRole(req.user); // Get role of the current user
const updates = pick(req.body, allowedFields[role]); // Only pick allowed fields

await Employee.update(updates, { where: { id: employeeId } });






Sure! When you create a new business and assign the role of owner to the user, you can also assign them the required permissions for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.

You'll need to have these permissions defined in your system and then associate them with the owner role.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Define Permissions: You may want to define permissions that correspond to CRUD operations in your Permission model.

Create Owner Role: When you create the owner role, you can associate it with all the CRUD permissions.

Assign Role to User: When a user creates a business, assign the owner role to them, which will implicitly give them all the CRUD permissions.

Here's some pseudo-code to give you a better idea of how this might look:


// Define CRUD permissions
const CRUD_PERMISSIONS = ['CREATE', 'READ', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'];

// Create owner role with CRUD permissions
const ownerRole = await Role.create({
  role_name: 'Owner',
});

CRUD_PERMISSIONS.forEach(async (permName) => {
  const permission = await Permission.create({ name: permName });
  await ownerRole.addPermission(permission);
});

// Assign owner role to user
const userRole = await UserRole.create({
  user_id: newUser.user_id,
  role_id: ownerRole.role_id
});


##### addAddress using the junction table on a many-to-many

When you set up a many-to-many relationship between User and Address using the belongsToMany method and specifying the through option, Sequelize will not directly add a user_id column to the Address table or an address_id column to the User table.

Instead, Sequelize will use a separate table called a junction table to manage the relationship between User and Address. In this case, the junction table is named UserAddress. This table will contain columns for both user_id and address_id, and each row in this table will represent a connection between a specific user and a specific address.



      const user = await User.findOne({ where: { user_id: someUserId } });
      const address = await Address.create({
        // address details here...
      });
      await user.addAddress(address);


The addAddress method (automatically provided by Sequelize when you define the many-to-many relationship) will create a new row in the UserAddress table, linking the specific user and address. You don't have to manually handle the user_id in the Address table or the address_id in the User table.

You can also query these relationships using methods like getAddresses on a User instance or getUsers on an Address instance.





If you define a many-to-many relationship between a User model and an Address model, Sequelize will create methods like addAddress, addAddresses, getAddresses, setAddresses, removeAddress, and removeAddresses on the instances of the User model.

Similarly, on the instances of the Address model, you'll have methods like addUser, addUsers, getUsers, setUsers, removeUser, and removeUsers.
The naming follows this pattern:

add + singular form of the associated model name
add + plural form of the associated model name
get + plural form of the associated model name
set + plural form of the associated model name
remove + singular form of the associated model name
remove + plural form of the associated model name
The singular and plural forms are determined by the name of the associated model. By default, Sequelize uses the model name you define (e.g., Address) as the singular form and automatically generates the plural form (e.g., Addresses) by adding an "s" at the end.

If you need to customize the naming of these methods or the naming of the associated model, you can use options like as when defining the association. For example:


          User.belongsToMany(models.Address, {
            through: 'UserAddress',
            as: 'Locations' // Custom alias
          });


With this alias, the methods on the User model would be named addLocation, getLocations, etc.
